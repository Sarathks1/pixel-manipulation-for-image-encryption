This project implements a straightforward image encryption tool that leverages pixel manipulation techniques to enhance image security. Users can perform operations such as swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel. The tool enables seamless encryption and decryption of images, providing an effective way to protect visual data.

Key Features
Pixel Swapping: Obscure image content by swapping pixel values.
Mathematical Operations: Apply basic operations (addition, subtraction) to pixels for encryption.
User-Friendly: Simple functions for easy encryption and decryption.
Versatile Format Support: Works with popular image formats like PNG and JPEG.
Perfect for anyone interested in basic image processing and encryption techniques!
